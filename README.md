# Knutt-Morris-Pratt-String-Matching-Algorithm-Analysis


Search algorithms have several features. Some of them are very fast, some of them differ from each other in terms of accuracy rather than speed. 
The KMP algorithm is an equilibrium algorithm. It forms the basis of other search algorithms and uses the table we will see as the KMP table.

It is checked whether the word to be searched in the target of the KMP is found in the text and what to do in these cases. In classical search methods, 
all possibilities are tried and concluded is aimed, but this means a long time and memory loss. KMP, on the other hand, performs a search by shortening the 
time and preventing memory loss by not doing some of these intermediate processes. It calculates the status of not doing intermediate operations based on the 
word to be searched.
